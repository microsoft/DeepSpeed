# Introduction

Generative AI (GenAI) has enabled transformative applications in a wide variety of domains, including chatbot, text summarization, and high-quality image and video generation. These capabilities are built on top of large foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs are typically based on the [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) network architecture, and include popular model families such as GPT and Llama. LLMs have grown beyond the memory capacity of a single accelerator (e.g., GPU), and so inferencing or training them requires distributed processing using multiple GPUs or even multiple nodes.

Tensor parallelism (TP) is a popular distributed technique for training LLMs. TP leverages the aggregate memory of multiple GPUs to fit LLMs by partitioning each model layer across the GPUs. However, TP incurs two communication collective operations for each partitioned layer, separately for the forward and backward passes. TP is appealing due to its excellent system efficiency in single-node cases, where GPUs are directly connected via high bandwidth links like NVLink and NVSwitch. However, TP falls short in multi-node cases due to the lower bandwidth of cross-node interconnects. [Prior work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06858) reports that communication can take up to 75\% of end-to-end training time. Figure 2 shows that even on the latest DGX-H100 nodes interconnected with high-end Infiniband of 400GB/s bandwidth, communication overheads remains as high as 43\% of end-to-end training iteration time. Recent advances in GeMM+NCCL kernel fusion are unable to fully hide communication overheads due to their limited scope of computation-communication overlapping. The trend of faster compute in newer GPUs (e.g., DGX-B200) indicates that the communication overheads of TP will be more pronounced in both single node and multiple node scenarios.

# Domino Highlights


* Domino is TP optimization technique that achieves **Near-Complete** communication hiding behind computation by decomposing a single batch training iteration into smaller and independent pieces, allowing efficient pipelining.

Domino is the first work that provides a **uniform** Tensor Parallelism (TP) solution for both single-node and **multi-node** cases. Traditional TP solutions (e.g., Megatron-LM) fall short in multi-node cases due to limited cross-node communication bandwidth.

### Performance

We tested Domino on 1 to 4 DGX-H100 boxes (8xH100 per box). Each node has intra-node NVLink bandwidth of 900GB/s and inter-node IB bandwidth of 400GB/s. We oberved the following performance results:
1. For both GPT and Llama model series, Domino outperforms Megatron-LM by up to **1.3x** and **1.2x** respectively in end-to-end training iteration throughput for different model sizes, sequence lengths and batch sizes. These results are summarized in Figure 1.
2. For several cases, Domino achieves **near-optimal** training throughput, where optimal throughput refers to the throughput achieved assuming the communication collectives of TP are disabled.

# Design Motivation

In this section, we briefly discuss three topics. First, we motivate why the time is right is for a uniform TP solution for both single node and multi-node cases. Next, we analyze the communication overhead on latest Nvidia DGX-H100 boxes with high cross-node communication interconnects. Finally, we describe TP's sequential data dependency which causing communication stands out.

### It is time for a uniform TP for single and multi-node scenarios

Nvidia is pushing hard on breaking communication bandwidth gap between intra-node (i.e., GPUs within a node connected with NVLink) and inter-node (i.e., cross-node connected with Infini-Band(IB)). For example, each DGX-H100 is equipped with eight ConnectX-7 network cards and gets aggregated cross-node bandwidth of 400GB/s, which is at same level of intra-node NVLink (900GB/s). Therefore, it is time for proposing a uniform solution for both single node and multi-node TP training.

### Communication Overhead in TP

As described in [Megatron-LM paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08053), for TP, every transformer block (i.e.,1 Self-Attention layer + 1 MLP layer) incurs 4 AllReduce calls, two in forward pass and two in the backward pass (shown in Figure 3). Given a LLM consisting of $N$ stacked transformer blocks, the number of AllReduce calls required for TP training is $4 * N$. Even for small models like GPT-3 2.7B or 6.7B which consists of 32 layers, the total number of AllReduce calls is 128 for every training iteration. For larger models, the number of AllReduce calls grows linearly with number of layers.

  *Figure 3: TP communication = 4 x AllReduce x num\_transformer\_block*

</div>

One big issue for TP is that the *communication resides on critical path of every input batch training execution* due to sequential data dependency we described in the following [TP data dependency analysis](#tp-data-dependency-analysis) section. Therefore, the communication overhead stands out and is difficult to hide behind computation. In Figure 4, we provide our communication overhead measurement using Megatron-LM training GPT-3 and Llama-2 model series with different model sizes and batch sizes across 1 to 4 DGX-H100 nodes (i.e., 8 to 32 H100 GPUs). The communication overhead is up to **47\%** despite using latest Nvidia hardware DGX-H100 with 400GB/s cross-node bandwidth.

</div>

As Llama-3 405B model training takes 54 days on 16,000 H100 GPUs, the projected communication time can be up to around **25 days on 16,000 H100s**. This finding shows that, despite using latest high-bandwidth interconnects like NVLink/Infini-Band(IB), the communication overheads of TP remains a huge portion of end-to-end training time.

### TP data dependency analysis

In traditional TP, shown in Figure 5, a transformer layer (either Attn or MLP layer) computation can be abstracted into $X\*A\*B=Y$, where $X$ is input. For attention layer, $A$ is attention computation (e.g., multihead-attention) and $B$ is linear layer. For MLP layer, both $A$ and $B$ are linear layers. An AllReduce is conducted on $Y$ after computation. Due to **sequential data dependency on $Y$ between computation (i.e., $X\*A\*B=Y$) and communication (i.e., AllReduce($Y$)), AllReduce($Y$) completely stands out**, thus making TP not efficient in limited communication bandwidth scenarios.

# Domino Design

Compared to Figure 5, Domino breaks data dependency of $X\*A\*B$ via [*Row-wise Split on Inputs X*](#row-wise-split-on-inputs-x), [*Column-wise Split on Weights B*](#column-wise-split-on-weights-b), as well as a [hybrid solution combining these two](#2d-split-on-both-x-and-b). After breaking computation into pieces, Domino pipelines computation and communication working on different independent pieces, thus achieving near-complete communication hiding behind computation. Domino's unique benefits are listed as follows:

1. Comparing with GeMM+NCCL kernel fusion techniques, Domino breaks data dependency thus has a much wider range of computation kernel sequences to overlap with NCCL call. For example, Domino can overlap AllReduce not only to a single GeMM, but also extend overlapping scope to multiple GeMMs, LayerNorm, DropOut and more.
2. Domino achieves near-complete communication hiding behind computation, thus also achieves near-optimal system throughput in certain cases. (Optimal throughput refers to end-to-end throughput that disables all communication in TP training.)
3. Domino works at kernel scheduler level, any kernel optimizations or new kernels can be seamlessly integrated into Domino framework.
4. Domino tensor partition scheme is simple and generic. It is easy for user side end-to-end correctness debugging when facing issues like overflow or weights/gradients errors.

For the ease of illustration, we describe forward propagation only (since backward pass is just in reverse order), and we describe only splitting tensor into two chunks.

## Row-wise split on Inputs X:

Domino breaks Input X in row dimension (i.e. batch dimension).

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/design-row.png" width="600"><br>

  *Figure 6: Domino row-wise (batch-dim) split on inputs X.*

</div>

**Data Dependency**: Split inputs' batch dimension has no data dependency for both intra-layer and inter-layer cases. Therefore, we achieve both *intra-layer* (AllReduce($Y1$) and $X2\*A\*B$) and *inter-layer* (AllReduce($Y2$) and next-layer's $X1\*A\*B$) computation-communication overlapping. With this batch split on inputs, Domino can hide up to **100\%** communication behind computation.

## Column-wise split on Weights B:

Domino breaks weight matrix B in column dimension.


<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/design-column.png" width="600"><br>

  *Figure 7: Domino column-wise (last-dim) split on weights B.*

</div>

**Data Dependency**: Split Weights B column-wise have no data dependency in intra-layer case but have data dependency in inter-layer case. Therefore, we only achieve *intra-layer*
 (AllReduce($Y1$) and $X2\*A\*B$) computation-communication overlapping. This column-split on weights scheme remains essential, since row-wise input split only would lead to narrow shape tensors that hinder kernel computational efficiency. In practice, Domino achieves 50\% to 70\% communication hiding behind computation with weights B column-wise split.

## 2D Split on both X and B:

For extremely large LLMs, Domino splits both inputs X and weights B in row and column dimension, separately. This method is beneficial for model training requiring both low memory footprints and minimizing communication overheads.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./images/design-hybrid.png" width="600"><br>

  *Figure 8: Domino 2D split on both inputs X and weights B.*

</div>

**Data Dependency**: This 2D split policy inherits synchronization at the end of each transformer layer due to column-wise split on weights B. Therefore, the 2D approach only achieves *intra-layer* computation-communication overlapping.

# Implementation and Optimization

For brevity, we summarize key implementation of row-wise input split. For more implementation details, please refer to our [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15241).

**Forward:** Figure 9 shows how we position and trigger NCCL calls in order to overlap with computation kernel sequences in forward propagation. We split batch into two chunks as $\mu$-batch0 and $\mu$-batch1. $\mu$-batch0 attention output as attn0 and MLP output as MLP0. $\mu$-batch1's attention output as attn1 and MLP output as MLP1. AllReduce(attn0) is overlapped with self-attention computation on $\mu$-batch1. For AllReduce(attn1), we group multiple $\mu$-batches' Dropout, Residual, LayerNorm computation-communication overlapping. This small kernel grouping not only enable complete hiding of AllReduce(attn1), but also provides proper overlapping space for AllReduce(MLP0) in the backward pass shown in Figure 10. For AllReduce(MLP0), we hide it behind $\mu$-batch1's MLP computation kernel sequence of GeMM + GeLU + GeMM. For AllReduce(MLP1), we hide it behind next layer's attention computation.

</div>

**Backward:** Figure 10 shows a simple example of batch split in to two $\mu$-batches as $\mu$-batch0 and $\mu$-batch1. Besides similar overlapping strategy in the forward pass, we extend the scope of overlap communication with weights' gradient computation inside same $\mu$-batch (e.g., AllReduce(MLP1) partially overlaps with its own $\mu$-batch1 computation as the 3rd orange block from left). Each *grad matmul* includes two separate GeMM computation for inputs gradient and weights gradient. Therefore, we can extend overlapping scope by overlapping AllReduce(MLP1) with $\mu$-batch1's weights gradient computation.

Backward is a bit more challenging because backward computation graph is automatically generated by torch.autograd(). To precisely control NCCL call triggering time, we implement a *no\_operation* module, which obtains communication handle during forward pass and retains it for use during backward pass. Our *no\_operation* module works seamlessly with torch.autograd(), and enable us precisely control NCCL start/end time without rewriting customized backward computation graph.

**General kernel optimizations:** We adopt general kernel-level optimization techniques. For example, we use cudaGraph to squeeze idle/bubble time between adjacent compute kernels to reduce end-to-end latency. We use CUDA multi-stream to increase parallel execution. We also leverage torch.compile() to further improve our system efficiency.
