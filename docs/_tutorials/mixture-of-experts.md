DeepSpeed v0.5 introduces new support for training Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. MoE models are an emerging class of sparsely activated models that have sublinear compute costs with respect to their parameters. For example, the [Switch Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961) consists of over 1.6 trillion parameters, while the compute required to train it is approximately equal to that of a 10 billion-parameter dense model. This increase in model size offers tremendous accuracy gains for a constant compute budget.

For more details on results and further discussion, please see our press release: [DeepSpeed powers 8x larger MoE model training with high performance]({{ site.press_release_v5 }}).

## Getting started with a simple MoE example

**Note:** DeepSpeed MoE requires Pytorch 1.8 or above.

As a simple starting point we will show how to apply DeepSpeed MoE to a cifar10 example. Please refer to
our [cifar10 example](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeedExamples/tree/master/cifar) going forward.

If you are adding MoE to an existing model you can use the snippet below to help guide you:


### Expert groups initialization

DeepSpeed MoE supports five different forms of parallelism, and it exploits both GPU and CPU memory. Its flexible design enables users to mix different types of prevalent parallelism techniques, as shown in the table below.

| Short Name       | Flexible Parallelism Configurations | Benefit                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| E                | Expert                              | Scales the model size by increasing the number of experts                   |
| E + D            | Expert + Data                       | Accelerates training throughput by scaling to multiple data parallel groups |
| E + Z            | Expert + ZeRO-powered data          | Partitions the nonexpert parameters to support larger base models           |
| E + D + M        | Expert + Data + Model               | Supports massive hidden sizes and even larger base models than E+Z          |
| E + D + Z        | Expert + Data + ZeRO-powered data   | Supports massive hidden sizes and even larger base models than E+Z          |
| E + Z-Off + M    | Expert + ZeRO-Offload + Model       | Leverages both GPU and CPU memory for large MoE models on limited # of GPUs |

To support different forms of parallelism, we create various process groups inside DeepSpeed. The helper functions that DeepSpeed uses reside in ```deepspeed.utils.groups.py```

Note: The following function has been deprecated now and model training code does not need to call this anymore.

```python
deepspeed.utils.groups.initialize(ep_size="desired expert-parallel world size")
```

Instead, the MoE layer API now accepts ```ep_size``` as an argument in addition to ```num_experts```. This new API allows users to create MoE models, which can have a different number of experts and a different expert parallelism degree for each MoE layer.

The GPUs (or ranks) participating in an expert-parallel group of size ```ep_size``` will distribute the total number of experts specified by the layer.

### MoE layer API

The hidden_size is the input dimension of a particular layer and the output dimension is the same as that. This could lead to some changes to your model definition, especially for vision/convolutional models because the input/output dimensions don't match in certain cases. E.g. in the CIFAR-10 example, we modify the third fully connected layer to add the MoE layer. To cater for this, we need to add an additional fully-connected layer, whose input dimension is equal to the output dimension of the MoE layer.

Original model config

```python
    self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)
```

Updated with MoE Layers

```python
    self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 84)
    self.fc3 = deepspeed.moe.layer.MoE(hidden_size=84, expert=self.fc3, num_experts=args.num_experts, ep_size=<desired expert-parallel world size> ...)
    self.fc4 = nn.Linear(84, 10)
```

### Pyramid-Residual MoE

Recently, we proposed a novel [Pyramid-Residual MoE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05596) (PR-MoE) model architecture. To create such an MoE model, the users need to do two additional things: 1) To make a pyramid structure, pass num_experts as a list e.g. [4, 8] and 2) Use the ```use_residual``` flag to indicate that the MoE layer is now a Residual MoE layer.

```python
self.experts = deepspeed.moe.layer.MoE(hidden_size=input_dim, expert=ExpertModule(), num_experts=[..], ep_size=ep_size, use_residual=True)
```

### An Example Scenario

Given a total number of GPUs in our world size and a subset of GPUs in our expert-parallel world as follows.

```python
WORLD_SIZE = 4
EP_WORLD_SIZE = 2
EXPERTS = [8]
```

The model code needs to use the deepspeed.moe.layer.MoE API as follows.

```python
self.experts = deepspeed.moe.layer.MoE(hidden_size=input_dim, expert=ExpertModule(), num_experts=EXPERTS, ep_size=EP_WORLD_SIZE)
```

With the above two commands, the DeepSpeed runtime will be set to train an MoE model with a total of 8 experts on 4 GPUs in 4 experts/GPU mode. We call this the E + D mode as described earlier in the table.


```python
import torch
import deepspeed
import deepspeed.utils.groups as groups
from deepspeed.moe.layer import MoE

WORLD_SIZE = 4
EP_WORLD_SIZE = 2
EXPERTS = 8

fc3 = torch.nn.Linear(84, 84)
fc3 = MoE(hidden_size=84, expert=self.fc3, num_experts=EXPERTS, ep_size=EP_WORLD_SIZE, k=1)
fc4 = torch.nn.Linear(84, 10)

```

For a runnable end-to-end example that covers both the standard MoE architecture as well as the PR-MoE model , please look at the [cifar10 example](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeedExamples/tree/master/cifar). In addition, see the advanced usage section of this tutorial that links to a more comprehensive example for NLG models.

### Combining ZeRO-Offload and DeepSpeed MoE for very large models

To use MoE Layers in DeepSpeed, we rely on two parameter groups that are passed to an optimizer. A concrete example to create such groups is available from the [cifar10 example](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeedExamples/tree/master/cifar).

The relevant function that creates these param groups is as follows.

```python
def create_moe_param_groups(model):
    from deepspeed.moe.utils import split_params_into_different_moe_groups_for_optimizer

    parameters = {'params': [p for p in model.parameters()], 'name': 'parameters'}

    return split_params_into_different_moe_groups_for_optimizer(parameters)
```

The above param groups can then be fed to the ZeRO stage-2 optimizer as follows.

```python
net = Net()

parameters = create_moe_param_groups(net)

model_engine, optimizer, trainloader, __ = deepspeed.initialize(
    args=args, model=net, model_parameters=parameters, training_data=trainset)
```

We are working on automating this functionality in the DeepSpeed ZeRO optimizer so the model training code can be simplified further.

To run the [cifar10 example](https://github.com/deepspeedai/DeepSpeedExamples/tree/master/cifar) with ZeRO-Offload (stage 2) and MoE, please set the ds_config flags

```json
"zero_optimization": {
      "stage": 2,
      "allgather_partitions": true,
      "reduce_scatter": true,
      "allgather_bucket_size": 50000000,
      "reduce_bucket_size": 50000000,
      "overlap_comm": true,
      "contiguous_gradients": true,
      "cpu_offload": true
  }
```

An additional optimization to save memory for extremely large model training on limited number of GPUs has also been introduced. Please enable that using the following config flag to the fp16 optimizer in ds_config.

  ```json
    "fp16": {
      "enabled": true,
      "fp16_master_weights_and_grads": true,
  }
  ```

## Random Token Selection

We have devised a new technique called “Random Token Selection” that greatly improves convergence. Random token selection addresses the limitation of biased selection problem in MoE model training. Our upcoming paper describes this technique and its results in detail. This feature is already part of the DeepSpeed runtime and is enabled by default so users can take advantage without any config flags or command-line arguments.

## Advanced MoE usage

We have added an example of applying MoE to NLG models. Please read more in this [newsletter](https://www.deepspeed.ai/2021/12/09/deepspeed-moe-nlg.html) and [tutorial](/tutorials/mixture-of-experts-nlg/).
