[DeepSpeed](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) is a deep learning optimization
library that makes distributed training easy, efficient, and effective.

DeepSpeed delivers extreme-scale model training for everyone, from data scientists training on massive supercomputers to those training on low-end clusters or even on a single GPU:
* Extreme scale: Using current generation of GPU clusters with hundreds of devices,  3D parallelism of DeepSpeed can efficiently train deep learning models with trillions of parameters.  
* Extremely memory efficient: With just a single GPU, ZeRO-Offload of DeepSpeed can train models with over 10B parameters, 10x bigger than the state of arts, democratizing multi-billion-parameter model training such that many deep learning scientists can explore bigger and better models.
* Extremely long sequence length: Sparse attention of DeepSpeed powers an order-of-magnitude longer input sequence and obtains up to 6x faster execution comparing with dense transformers.  
* Extremely communication efficient: 3D parallelism improves communication efficiency allows users to train multi-billion-parameter models 2–7x faster on clusters with limited network bandwidth.  1-bit Adam reduces communication volume by up to 5x while achieving similar convergence efficiency to Adam, allowing for scaling to different types of GPU clusters and networks.

Early adopters of DeepSpeed have already produced
a language model (LM) with over 17B parameters called
[Turing-NLG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/turing-nlg-a-17-billion-parameter-language-model-by-microsoft),
establishing a new SOTA in the LM category.

DeepSpeed is an important part of Microsoft’s new
[AI at Scale](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-at-scale/)
initiative to enable next-generation AI capabilities at scale, where you can find more
information [here](https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/exploring-ai-at-scale).

# Why DeepSpeed?
Training advanced deep learning models is challenging. Beyond model design,
model scientists also need to set up the state-of-the-art training techniques
such as distributed training, mixed precision, gradient accumulation, and
checkpointing. Yet still, scientists may not achieve the desired system
performance and convergence rate. Large model sizes are even more challenging:
a large model easily runs out of memory with pure data parallelism and it is
difficult to use model parallelism. DeepSpeed addresses these challenges to
accelerate model development *and* training.

# Installation

The quickest way to get started with DeepSpeed is via pip, this will install
the latest release of DeepSpeed which is not tied to specific PyTorch or CUDA
versions. DeepSpeed includes several C++/CUDA extensions that we commonly refer
to as our 'ops'.  By default, all of these extensions/ops will be built
just-in-time (JIT) using [torch's JIT C++ extension loader that relies on
ninja](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cpp_extension.html) to build and
dynamically link them at runtime.

**Note:** [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) must be installed _before_ installing
DeepSpeed.

```bash
pip install deepspeed
```

After installation, you can validate your install and see which extensions/ops
your machine is compatible with via the DeepSpeed environment report.

```bash
ds_report
```

If you would like to pre-install any of the DeepSpeed extensions/ops (instead
of JIT compiling) or install pre-compiled ops via PyPI please see our [advanced
installation instructions](https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/advanced-install/).
